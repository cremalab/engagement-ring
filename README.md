# Engagement Ring

The front-end application for Vot.io, a real-time voting and discussion application. It's a [Chaplin](http://chaplinjs.org) app built
with [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

Auto-build and run a server with `brunch watch --server`. It opens a web-socket
connection with the Votio Faye server and sends regular RESTful requests to the
Votio API.
